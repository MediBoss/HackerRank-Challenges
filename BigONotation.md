# BigO Notation

### Overview 

In computer science, BigO notation is a way to measure time and space complexity of a given algorithm.

#### O(1) - constant Time

This runtime referes to algorithms that performes at a constant time regardless of the input size.

``` python

def print_name(name):
''' 
  Worst Case : O(1)
'''

  print(name)
```

#### O(log n) - Logarithmic Time

#### O(n) - Linear Time

#### O(n log n) - 


#### O(n^2) - Quadratic Time


#### O(2^n) - 



#### O(n!)
