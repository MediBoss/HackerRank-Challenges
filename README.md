# Technical Interview Preparation

## A problem-Solving Flow Chart

1. Listen (write down important information about the question)
2. Example
3. Brute Force
4. Optimize
5. Walk Through
6. Implement 
7. Test

### Listen

  * Listen very carefully to the question being asked.
  * Make sure you have captured important informations(mentally or writting them down)
  * Listen to keywords such as "sorted" as it might be helful on solving the problem.
  * If you find yourself stuck, make sure to refer back to the information you wrote down.
  
  
### Draw an example

  * An example helps you visualize a question.
  * Example needs to be specific. Should use real numbers or strings(if applicable to the problem)
  * Example needs to be sufficiently large.
  * Example should not be a special case at first.
  

### State a brute force

  * Find a brute force. State it even if it's not optimal.
  * Explain its space and time complexity.
  * It is a great starting point since it helps you get a bigger idea of the problem/solution.
  

### Optimize

  * Look for any unused information. Is the array sorted? use that to improve the brute force
  * Use a fresh diffrent example to view things from a different perspective.
  * Make time vs space tradeoff. Ask your interviewer which needs to be prioritize.
  * Precompute information. Is there a way to reoganize the data beforehand that will save time afterwards?

### Walk through


### Implement

### Test

NOTE: Keep talking out loud throughout this whole process.
